"""Canonical 2026 chassis/aero development history for LatentLap.

This module deliberately separates *what was declared/brought* from whether a
change should alter the prediction model's historical weighting.

Categories
----------
persistent       A lasting chassis/aero development carried forward.
circuit_specific A configuration/range change for a particular circuit.
reliability      Reliability/cooling/structural change without a defensible
                 persistent pace step.

Power-unit ADUO events remain in ``config.PU_ADUO_UPGRADES`` because they have
separate regulatory semantics.

Only entries with all of:
    status == "confirmed"
    category == "persistent"
    affects_prediction is True
are consumed by the prediction weighting logic.

The inventory was audited through R13 against official F1/FIA-style weekend
upgrade declarations, with reputable technical reporting used for context and
significance. Significance is intentionally manual/reviewable rather than LLM-
generated.
